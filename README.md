# One-Feature-Linear-Regression
This project demonstrates a simple one-feature linear regression model built with Python and NumPy. It walks through the entire process, from loading and visualizing the data to implementing linear regression, computing the cost function, and optimizing parameters using gradient descent.
# Enhanced Linear Regression (One-Feature)

## Overview

This project implements a **simple one-feature linear regression model** using **Python and NumPy**. It is designed as a learning-focused project that demonstrates the **complete linear regression pipeline**, from raw data handling to optimization using gradient descent.

The goal of this repository is to build strong intuition for how linear regression works **under the hood**, without relying on high-level ML libraries.

## What This Project Covers

The notebook walks through the following steps:

* Visualizing the relationship between the input feature and output variable
* Implementing the linear regression hypothesis function
* Computing the cost function (Mean Squared Error)
* Optimizing parameters using **gradient descent**
* Observing how parameters and loss change over iterations

---

## Main Concepts Covered

This project focuses on understanding the **core ideas behind linear regression**, rather than treating it as a black-box algorithm. The main concepts explored include:

* **Linear regression hypothesis**: modeling the relationship between input and output using a linear equation
* **Cost function (Mean Squared Error)**: measuring how well the model fits the data
* **Gradient descent**: iteratively optimizing model parameters to minimize the cost
* **Learning rate**: understanding its effect on convergence and stability
* **Parameter convergence**: observing how weights and bias change over time
* **Data visualization**: using plots to interpret data trends and model performance

## Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib** (for visualization)
* **Seaborn** (also for visualization)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
